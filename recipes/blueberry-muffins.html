        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
           <li>195g all-purpose flour</li> 
           <li>150g granulated sugar, plus 1 tablespoon for muffin tops</li>
           <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
           <li>1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
           <li>80ml vegetable or avocado oil</li>
           <li>1 large egg</li>
           <li>80ml milk or milk substitute</li>
           <li>1 &frac12; teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
           <li>1 cub fresh or frozen blueberries</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to <strong>400&deg;F</strong>. Line muffin cups with paper liners.</li>
            <li>Whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Add oil to separate bowl, then crack the egg and pour in the milk. Add the vanilla extract and whisk until combined.</li>
            <li>Add the wet ingredients to the bowl with the dry ingredients. Stir gently until the batter comes together.</li>
            <li>Divide the batter evenly between the muffin cups. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until tops are no longer wet and a toothpick inserted into the muffin comes out with crumbs, not batter.</li>
            <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
        </ol>
